ThinFAT32
=========

A lightweight implementation of the FAT32 filesystem for embedded systems.

Objective
---------
The purpose of ThinFAT32 is to be an easy to deploy, low-resource FAT32 filesystem for your embedded application.  The idea is not to go for speed or a lot of wacky features, but basic functionality in a library that is *easy to use.*  Let's not use a lot of super-optimized code, wacky linker techniques, or kooky C language features.  Let's just imlpement FAT32 by the books, as efficiently as we can without going apeshit, and then use it in our embedded systems.
